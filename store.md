	<h1 class="pageTitle">Buy Calendars</h1>
	<p>This year we're selling calendars online to try and minimise cash transactions in these Covid-themed days we live in now. If you buy via Auricle at the link below, you can either collect your calendar from one of our sponsors, or we'll deliver it to you (if you live near Harrison Park).</p>
	<h2 class="pageTitle"><a href="https://auricleshop.myshopify.com/collections/dogs-of-harrison-park-calendar-2021">Buy Now (via Auricle)</a></h2>
	<h3>Pricing</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>£10 each</li>
		<li>3 for £25</li>
	</ul>
  <h2>Collect In-Store</h2>
  <p>The following sponsors will all stock the Dogs of Harrison Park Calendar:</p>
  <ul>
		<li><a href="https://teaandsympathy.me/">Tea & Sympathy</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.pollination.co.uk/">Pollination</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/theterracecafeshandon/">The Terrace Cafe</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.stardogs.org.uk/">Star Dogs</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.thecaleysampleroom.co.uk/">The Caley Sample Room</a></li>
  </ul>
	<p>Where possible, we're asking people to order online at Auricle and collect in-store to avoid our sponsors incurring card vendor charges on our behalf. If you want to collect in store, please put the <b>business name</b> in the address field, and you can collect your calendars from there when you show your proof of purchase!</p>
	<p>If you do still want to purchase the calendar at one of the businesses sponsoring the calendar, you can do so via a PayPal payment. In certain cases, the businesses may accept cash or card, so please do ask them.</p>
	<h2>Delivery</h2>
  <p>We'll also be selling calendars for delivery <b>if you live nearby</b> (as delivery will be via Cameron and Charlie out on a run). For clarification, that would be approximately within this area:</p>

	<p>We'll try to get calendars delivered within a couple of days of ordering, but as it will depend on my running schedule, it may take a little longer - if you've not received an order within 5 working days, please feel free to drop us a message and tell me to get my running shoes on!</p>
	<p>If you live outwith this area but want to order for delivery, please drop us an email first so we can figure out postage costs (or if you're elsewhere in Edinburgh, when we'll next be out running that way)!</p>
	<h2>Collect From Us</h2>
	<p>We (Danny and Cameron) will also have some calendars with us when we're in the park with Sid and Charlie. We'll be able to take <b>cash or card</b> for these, although we can't guarantee we'll be there all the time!</p>
