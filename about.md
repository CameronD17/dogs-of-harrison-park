	<h2>The Calendar</h2>
	<p>The first Dogs of Harrison Park Calendar was made by Danny in 2018, collecting pictures of dogs from around the park just through talking with other dog owners, and selling the calendar in largely the same way, with a full backpack of them wandering around the park of an evening with Sid the cockapoo. From the 2020 calendar, collecting pictures has been streamlined via this site, making it easier for people to get images to us, and find out more about the calendar, rather than relying on bumping into us in the park.</p>
  <h3>Previous Calendar Success</h3>
  <p>The 2018 calendar raised £480 for the Dog's Trust.</p>
  <p>The 2019 calendar raised £500 for the Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home.</p>
  <p>The 2020 calendar raised another £550 for the Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home.</p>
	<h2>Danny & Cameron</h2>
  <p>We have lived in Shandon for the last few years with our two dogs, Sid the Cockapoo, and Charlie the Border Collie. We fell in love with the vibrant community of the area, immediately, as this little corner of Edinburgh is home to families, young professionals, local businesses and last, but not least, dog owners.</p>
	<p>Walking our dogs in Harrison Park has shown us the incredible support and kindness exhibited by the Shandon locals, and this wonderful community has enabled the success of the Dogs of Harrison Park Calendar for the last three years.</p>
