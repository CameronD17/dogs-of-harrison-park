	<h2>Danny & Cameron</h2>
  <p>We have lived in Shandon for the last few years and have been impressed by the vibrant community of the area. This little corner of Edinburgh is home to families, young professionals, local businesses and last, but not least, dog owners.</p>
	<p>Walking our dogs in Harrison Park has shown us the incredible support and kindness exhibited by the Shandon locals, and this wonderful community has enabled the success of the Dogs of Harrison Park Calendar for the last three years.</p>
  <h2>Previous Calendars</h2>
  <p>In previous years, calendar images have been collected by word-of-mouth, and printed calendars distributed in largely the same manner. This year, we're trying to streamline this process and make it easier for people to get images to us, and find out more about the calendar, rather than relying on bumping into us in the park.</p>
  <p>The 2018 calendar raised £480 for the Dog's Trust.</p>
  <p>The 2019 calendar raised £500 for the Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home.</p>
  <p>The 2020 calendar raised another £550 for the Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home.</p>
