description: We're no longer accepting photo uploads for the 2021 Dogs of Harrison Park Calendar
---

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hank you all so much for the photos you've uploaded to be included in the 2021 Dogs of Harrison Park Calendar! We had a lot of submissions this year, but all dogs are guaranteed to have at least one photo in the calendar.</p>

<p>An extra special thanks to the 20+ people who donated an additional Â£5 to have their dog's birthdays added to the calendar!</p>

<p>The calendar is being designed now, and we are aiming to have it sent to the printers sometime this week, and hopefully the calendars will be available for sale in mid-November. An update will be posted here nearer the time with details of where they can be bought once they arrive from the printers.</p>
