  <h2>Send us pictures!</h2>
  <p>The most important way to get involved is to upload pictures of your dog in or around Harrison Park! Here are some tips for an ideal upload:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide three to six high-resolution and focused images. Clearer images will be easier to fit into the calendar.</li>
    <li>Ensure all images have been taken in or around Harrison Park (this is not mandatory, but priority will be given to "park-themed" pictures!)</li>
    <li>Pictures that include your dog(s) playing with other dogs in the park are highly encouraged!</li>
    <li>Where possible, do not include humans in the pictures (especially not faces).</li>
  </ul>
	<p class="intro">Please enter your DOG'S name (not your own) when prompted after the images have been uploaded!</p>
