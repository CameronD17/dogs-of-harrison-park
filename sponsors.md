  <h1 class="pageTitle">Our Chosen Charity</h1>
  <h2>Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home</h2>
  <p>Our chosen charity for fundraising is the Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home (EDCH). The EDCH receive no government funding, and relies solely on donations from the Edinburgh community. As the calendar is dog-themed, we try to support local business and charities where possible, and of course, we are dog-lovers ourselves, it is naturally one of the closest causes to our hearts.<p>

  <blockquote><span class="dropcap">A</span>t Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home, we are hugely reliant on everyone who supports us â€“ particularly as we receive no government or statutory funding. We would not be able to continue our work without supporters like you; donating money, spreading awareness of our charity, giving your time and raising vital funds for the animals in our care.</blockquote>
  <p>You can also <a href="https://www.edch.org.uk/donate">donate directly</a> to the Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home.</p>
